Cleaning Room Service on Demand

The paper presented below explains the operation and development of a Cleaning Room Service on-demand application.

After living a couple of weeks in our first-class university, we have noticed a problem. There is no option to request cleaning for our rooms in case of them being extremely dirty, or due to an unexpected situation.

With the development of this application, with a couple of taps, you can request a cleaning room service.

How's it works?
    • Pick a time: Select the date and time for your service and get instant, affordable pricing 
    • Book instantly: The app will confirm your appointment and take care of the payment electronically and securely 
    • Cleaning room service: an experienced, fully-equipped professional will show up on time at your doorstep

The application must contain:
    • Administrator module to make all the necessary configurations for the correct operation, establishment of cleaning schedules, number of rooms and buildings, estimated waiting times. 
    • GUI available for IOS, Android, and website.

The development of the application will be through the use of the following technologies:
    • MySQL
    • Python
    • React JS
